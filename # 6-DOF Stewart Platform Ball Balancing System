# stewart-platform-ball-balancing
Personal 6-DOF Stewart Platform project for ball balancing using PID control.

## Overview
- Full mechanical design in SolidWorks
- Custom 3D-printed structure
- 6 × MG90S servo motors
- 4-wire resistive touch sensor
- PID control tuned through physical testing

## Key Results
- Stable ball balancing for 20+ seconds
- Physical verification of full 6-DOF kinematics via 0° platform leveling

## Tools
- SolidWorks
- Arduino
- PID Control
