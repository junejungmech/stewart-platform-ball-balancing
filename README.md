# 6-DOF Stewart Platform Ball Balancing System

Personal mechanical engineering project implementing a 6-DOF Stewart Platform for ball balancing using inverse kinematics and PID control.

## Overview
- Full mechanical design in SolidWorks
- Custom 3D-printed structure
- 6 × MG90S servo motors
- 4-wire resistive touch sensor
- PID control tuned through physical testing
